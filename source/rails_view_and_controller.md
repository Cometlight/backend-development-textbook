Rails Views and Controller
==========================

The Rails View is concerened with displaying output. The
controller is concerned with handling incoming requests,
and using the model and views to generate a result.

After reading this guide you should

* understand the role of view, controller and routing in rails
* be able to adapt the views generated by the scaffold generator
* be able to adapt the controllers generated by the scaffold generator

-------------------------------------------------------

The View
--------

The View in the Model-View-Controller pattern
is responsible for displaying Data to the user in various ways.

In Ruby on Rails **Embedded Ruby** (ERB) is normally used
as the templating languages to define the views.  If you have
used Templates in other languages or have used PHP embedded in HTML
than you will recognize the similarities.

Both Web Designers and Web Developers might want to edit
the files concerning the view. (This is one of the points where
using git to relove merge conflicts comes in handy!).

### rails views

* are stored in `app/views/<name of controller>/*.html.erb`
* template format `.erb` is html with embedded ruby:
* `<% ruby code here %>` just evaluates the code
* `<%= ruby code here %>` evaluates the code and includes result
* main template (for header, footer) in `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`
* `yield`s to include single view


### static content

* anything placed in `public`
* is directly accessible in the web space, without going through rails!


### links

* never write links to your own app "by hand"!
* use helper methods to get the right URLs
* `link_to 'link text here', object` links to show action of the object
* use `rake routes` to find out the names of urls/paths

The Controller
--------------


### restful resources

a rails convention about which http methods and urls
you should use, and which controllers and methods you should use.

in `config/routes.rb`  

``` ruby
resources :zombies
```


![scaffold](images/rest.png)


``` 
GET    /zombies          zombies_controller def index
POST   /zombies          zombies_controller def create
GET    /zombies/new      zombies_controller def new
GET    /zombies/:id/edit zombies_controller def edit
GET    /zombies/:id      zombies_controller def show
PUT    /zombies/:id      zombies_controller def update
DELETE /zombies/:id      zombies_controller def destroy
```

### nested resources #


### card belongs_to board

* one model belongs to another, and is dependent
* `has_many :cards, :dependent => :destroy`
* makes sense to nest urls:
* /boards/3/cards  - all the cards in board 3


Routes
-------


### routes file:

``` ruby
resources :boards do
  resources :cards
end
```

### Routes constructed by nested resources

``` sh
GET    /boards                          
POST   /boards                          
GET    /boards/new                      
GET    /boards/:id/edit                 
GET    /boards/:id                      
PUT    /boards/:id                      
DELETE /boards/:id                      
GET    /boards/:board_id/cards          
POST   /boards/:board_id/cards          
GET    /boards/:board_id/cards/new      
GET    /boards/:board_id/cards/:id/edit 
GET    /boards/:board_id/cards/:id      
PUT    /boards/:board_id/cards/:id      
DELETE /boards/:board_id/cards/:id      
```
