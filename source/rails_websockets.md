Rails Websockets
=======================

While HTTP only allows requests from the client sent to the server,
websockets offer a permanent connection between client and server.
With Actioncable you can use websockets for publish-subscribe communication.

By referring to this guide, you will be able to:

* Incorporate "Server Push" funktionality in your app
* Build a chat app in your webapp

REPO: You can study the [code](https://github.com/backend-development/rails-example-stepstones) and try out [the demos](https://stepstones.herokuapp.com/) for the example app described here.
